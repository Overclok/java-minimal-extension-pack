This extension pack packages some of the most popular (and some I find very useful) VSCode Java extensions.

## Extensions Included

Check out [Java in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5002870) to get started.
This package includes:
    * Language Support for Javaâ„¢ by Red Hat

    * Visual Studio IntelliCode


* [Checkstyle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-checkstyle) - Provide real-time feedback about Checkstyle violations and quick fix actions. Great extension to make sure you're following the code conventions (can customize to use Google or Sun convention).


**Enjoy!**
